Subsequently, they were asked to evaluate how much they enjoyed the respective activities\nConstruct: Self-constructed, based on the DIAMONDS scale Rauthmann & Sherman (2016) and the WARN-D study protocol Fried et al. (2022), a similar longitudinal digital phenotyping study. We aimed to find a balance between sparsity of items and high degree of situational coverage.\n2 Items\n\n\n\nShow Items\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nItem\nScale\nScale Endpoints\nMeasurement Time\n\n\n\n\n\nHow did you spent the time since the last beep [since waking up]?

The original TAI contains 3 subscales, covering in-session activities, passivity towards the therapist and out-of-session activities. As we were interested in assessing therapeutic agency in everyday life, our TAI-EMA items are based on the “out-of-session activities” subscales and cover cognitive and behavioral aspects of TA\n4 Items\n\n\n\nShow Items\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nItem\nScale\nScale Endpoints\nMeasurement Time\n\n\n\n\n\nPrompted by my therapy today, I have … / Today I have …\n\n\n\n\n\nta_behavioral_1\n… implemented ideas or tasks from therapy\n1-2-3-4-5-6-7\nnot at all - very much\n1x/day, 8th beep\n\n\nta_behavioral_2\n… tried to think differently about things\n1-2-3-4-5-6-7\nnot at all - very much\n1x/day, 8th beep\n\n\nta_cognitive_1\n… thought about something that was discussed in therapy\n1-2-3-4-5-6-7\nnot at all - very much\n1x/day, 8th beep\n\n\nta_cognitive_2\n… done something to improve my situation\n1-2-3-4-5-6-7\nnot at all - very much\n1x/day, 8th beep\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhysical Fitness\n\nDescription: Participants were asked how physically healthy they had felt today on the last beep of the day\nConstruct: Self-constructed\n1 Item\n\n\n\nShow Items\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nItem\nScale\nScale Endpoints\nMeasurement Time\n\n\n\n\nphysical_health\nHow physically healthy did you feel today?\n-2, -1, 0, 1, 2\nworse than usual / normal / better than usual\n1x/day, 8th beep\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nECG Control\n\nDescription: During measurement bursts, patients were asked twice per day to conduct a resting-state ECG on their Scanwatch.
